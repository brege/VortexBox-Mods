These are some files I've modified for a better VortexBox experience.

Most of the changes I've made to the VortexBox files are Web UI related:  changethe CSS, HTML templates, PHP files, and some scripts.  My hope is that with a better and validated HTML, the code would be easier to parse for an android app.

Also, I've added an option to mirror FLAC to Ogg to the Web UI, and made the scripts flac2ogg.sh and flac-ogg-mirror to do so.

Some things can be improved, so I'm putting this here so others can help fork VortexBox to include new options and a better user experience.
