<p>mp3 is a lossy compression. You can trade sound quality for file size. The best quality is 320kbit/s fix bitrate. 320kbit/s fix is very high quality but still a decent size. 160kbit/s variable bitrate is good for playback devices with limited memory or streaming over a low bandwidth internet connection.</p>
