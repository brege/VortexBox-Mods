<p>FLAC mirror allows you to convert your FLAC files to other formats. VortexBox currently supports mp3 files and mp4 (Apple lossless m4a) files.  You can start a conversion and FLAC mirror will convent all your FLAC files to the desired format. The next time you start the mirror only the new FLAC files will be mirrored.</p>
