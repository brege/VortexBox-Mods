<p>Ogg Vorbis is a lossy compression and free software from Xiph.org. The best quality is q10 (~500 kbit/s); the standard is q8 (~256 kbit/s) and reduces the file size to around a third of the original FLAC.  For deeper compression, consider a smaller format (e.g. q6 or q4) for personal media players and low-bandwidth internet streaming.</p>
