<p>Ogg Vorbis is a lossy compression and free software. The best quality is q10 (~500 kbit/s); the standard is q8 (~256 kbit/s) and reduces the file size to around a third of the original bit-perfect FLAC.  For deeper compression, consider a smaller format (like q6) for personal media players and low-bandwidth internet streaming.</p>
